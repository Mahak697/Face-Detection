# Face-Detection
A face detection project involves building a system to automatically locate human faces in images or video streams, typically by using computer vision techniques like machine learning algorithms trained on large datasets. These projects often use pre-trained classifiers, such as Haar Cascades or LBP Cascades, with a framework like Python and the OpenCV library to process video from a webcam in real-time
